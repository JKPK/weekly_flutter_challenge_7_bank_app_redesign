# weekly_flutter_challenge_7_bank_app_redesign

## Challenge summary:
This challenge is about recreating Halo Mobile's designs: [Alfa-Bank Ukraine App Redesign](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Theme-class.html). 

## Things that I have learned during the development of this challenge app:
1. [BackdropFilter](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BackdropFilter-class.html) & [ImageFilter](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/ImageFilter-class.html).
2. [RaisedButton](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/RaisedButton-class.html) with a shape of [RoundedRectangleBorder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/RoundedRectangleBorder-class.html).
3. [Slider](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Slider-class.html) & [SliderTheme](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SliderTheme-class.html).
4. [Checkbox](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Checkbox-class.html) and styling it with a [Theme](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Theme-class.html) parent.
5. I have also gained better feel of animations and transformations.
